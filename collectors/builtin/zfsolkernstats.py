ZFS on Linux kernel memory statistics for TSDB

This plugin tracks kernel memory for both:

- the SPL and its allocated slabs backing ZFS memory
  zfs.mem.slab
- the ARC and its various values
  zfs.mem.arc
'''

# /proc/spl/slab has several fields.  we only care about the sizes
# and the allocation sizes for the slabs
# /proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats is a table.  we only care about the data column
