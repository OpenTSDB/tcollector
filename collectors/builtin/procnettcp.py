"""TCP socket state data for TSDB"""
#
# Read /proc/net/tcp, which gives netstat -a type
# data for all TCP sockets.

# Note this collector generates a lot of lines, given that there are
#  lots of tcp states and given the number of subcollections we do.
#  We rely heavily on tcollector's deduping.  We could be lazy and
#  just output values only for which we have data, except if we do
#  this then any counters for which we had data would never reach
#  zero since our state machine never enters this condition.

# Metric: proc.net.tcp

# For each run, we classify each connection and generate subtotals.
#   TSD will automatically total these up when displaying
#   the graph, but you can drill down for each possible total or a
#   particular one.  This does generate a large amount of datapoints,
#   as the number of points is (S*(U+1)*V) (currently ~400), where
#   S=number of TCP states, U=Number of users to track, and
#   V=number of services (collections of ports)
# The deduper does dedup this down very well, as only 3 of the 10
# TCP states are generally ever seen, and most servers only run one
# service under one user.  On a typical server this dedups down to
# under 10 values per interval.

# Each connection is broken down with a tag for user=username (see
#   "users" list below) or put under "other" if not in the list.
#   Expand this for any users you care about.
# It is also broken down for each state (state=).
# It is also broken down into services (collections of ports)

# Note that once a connection is closed, Linux seems to forget who
# opened/handled the connection.  For connections in time_wait, for
# example, they will always show user=root.
