Description: data collection framework for OpenTSDB
 OpenTSDB is a distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB) written on 
 top of HBase. OpenTSDB was written to address a common need: store, index
 and serve metrics collected from computer systems (network gear, operating
 systems, applications) at a large scale, and make this data easily 
 accessible and graphable.
 .
 tcollector is the data collection framework for OpenTSDB.
